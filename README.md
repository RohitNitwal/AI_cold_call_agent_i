# AI Cold Calling Agent (Hinglish)

## Project Overview
The **AI Cold Calling Agent (Hinglish)** is an innovative, AI-driven system designed to conduct personalized and human-like cold calls in Hinglishâ€”a blend of Hindi and English. The agent supports multiple business scenarios:
- **Demo Scheduling:** Schedule product demos for ERP systems.
- **Candidate Interviewing:** Conduct initial screening interviews.
- **Payment/Order Follow-up:** Remind customers about pending payments or order placements.

This project leverages the Gemini generative model for dynamic dialogue generation and integrates speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities for real-time voice interactions. The graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter provides an intuitive way to manage the conversation and view detailed logs and summaries.
